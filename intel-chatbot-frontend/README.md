# Inteliigent Chatbot React App

## Description

The Chatbot React App is an advanced application built with React that integrates multiple technologies to provide a rich user experience. Key features include:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring an additional verification step. Users need to download the [Microsoft Authenticator app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app) to complete the authentication process.
- **Chat-4O Model:** Utilizes the sophisticated Chat-4O model for delivering intelligent and context-aware responses, enhancing the conversational quality.
- **OpenAI API:** Leverages the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/) to generate conversational responses and handle natural language processing.
- **Google Maps API:** Integrates the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) to provide interactive map features and location-based functionalities.
- **Chart and Table Generation:** Capable of generating a variety of charts and tables for data visualization using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [react-chartjs-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2).
- **Profile Management:** Includes functionalities for users to manage their profiles, such as updating personal information, changing passwords, and deleting accounts.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication enhances the security of user accounts by requiring a second form of verification. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Setup:** During the sign-in process, users will be prompted to enter a code from the Microsoft Authenticator app.
2. **Authentication:** Open the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device to get the code.
3. **Verification:** Enter the code into the application to complete the authentication process.

For more information, refer to the [Microsoft Authenticator app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app).

## APIs and Libraries Used

- **[OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/):** Provides the backend for generating intelligent conversational responses.
